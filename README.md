# Golang and Python Webserver

This project is a simple webserver built using golang and python.

The main function has four routes {
    The ***root (/)*** route for returns the *index.html* which is also a form file.
    The ***/form*** route is the post destination of the *index.html* file.
    The ***/hello*** route that will call the *hello function* that returns *Hello*.
    The ***/bal route*** returns the *bal_sheet.html* file
    }

The form file and balance sheet with their css file were projects I did on Freecodecamp.
